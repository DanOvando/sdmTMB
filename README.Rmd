# sdmTMB

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/pbs-assess/sdmTMB.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pbs-assess/sdmTMB)
[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

## Installation

You can install sdmTMB with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("pbs-assess/sdmTMB")
```

## Goals of sdmTMB:

- Be useful for our purpose of fitting high resolution species distribution models for groundfish with spatiotemporal GLMMs and estimating range shift metrics. Possibly be useful for other applications.
- Have an interface that will be familiar to people who have used packages such as glmmTMB, lmer, or mgcv. E.g. accept formulas, use a `predict()` and `residuals()` method, and present options as clear named arguments.
- Not fit the kitchen sink, but do what it does elegantly. I.e. be opinionated in what it does.

## Example

The main function is `sdmTMB()`. See `?sdmTMB` and `?predict.sdmTMB` for the most complete examples. More details to come...

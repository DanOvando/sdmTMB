## Add OpenMP flags for compiling the model
## From https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#OpenMP-support:
## > Note that the macro SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS applies to the default
## C++ compiler and not necessarily to the C++11/14/17 compiler: users
## of the latter should do their own configure checks. If you do use your
## own checks, make sure that OpenMP support is complete by compiling and
## linking an OpenMP-using program: on some platforms the runtime library
## is optional and on others that library depends on other optional libraries.
## > Packages which include C++ code should use SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS in PKG_LIBS
## PKG_CXXFLAGS += $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)
## PKG_LIBS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)
